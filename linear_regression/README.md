# Linear Regression - Machine Learning Algorithim from scratch

This module implements Linear Regression from scratch only using NumPy library
The goal is to understand how gradient descent, weight and bias updates, cost function and linear algebra works internally without scikit-learn

The project includes:
--Linear regression class
--Manual testing
--Synthetic testing
--Using .csv file testing


# Math explanation
Hypothesis:  y(x) = w * x + b

Cost function: L = (1/2m) * np.sum(pow((y(x) - y)),2)

Gradients: 
    dw = (1/m) * pow(X,T) * (y(x) - y)
    db = (1/m) * sum(y(x) - y)

Updating weights and bias:
    weights = weight - α * dw
    bias = bias - α * db

    α -> learning rate
